## How It Works

Urduify does not use a learning model. 

For translation from Roman Urdu to Urdu, Urduify uses a dictionary which consists of Roman Urdu and Urdu word pairs. This dictionary has more than 16,000 word pairs, and was assembled using a total of six datasets. 

For translation from Urdu to Roman Urdu, Urduify uses another dictionary which maps Urdu characters to their corresponding English letters. Hence, translation is done character by character.
